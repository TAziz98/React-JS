          That may all sound complicated, but it really isn’t. The main purpose
          of your About Us page is to give visitors a glimpse into the identity
          of either a person or business. As users discover your brand, they
          need to distinguish what sets you apart and makes you… you. This often
          requires finding the right balance between compelling content and a
          design carefully planned to look the part. Conveying your identity in
          a fun and approachable – but also reliable and informative – way is
          challenging. If you know who you are and your goal for your site, the
          About Us page should come naturally. However, if you’re looking for
          some inspiration, you can always check out these 25 examples of
          creative and engaging About Us pages. These excellent examples will
