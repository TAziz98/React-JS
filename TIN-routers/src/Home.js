          A home page is generally the main page a visitor navigating to a
          website from a web search engine will see, and it may also serve as a
          landing page to attract visitors.[1][2] The home page is used to
          facilitate navigation to other pages on the site by providing links to
          prioritized and recent articles and pages, and possibly a search
          box.[3] For example, a news website may present headlines and first
          paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles, in a dynamic
          web page that reflects the popularity and recentness of stories.[4]
          Meanwhile, other websites use the homepage to attract users to create
          an account. Once they are logged in, the homepage may be redirected to
          their profile page. This may in turn be referred to as the "personal
          home page".[5] A website may have multiple home pages, although most
          have one.[6] Wikipedia, for example, has a home page at wikipedia.org,
          as well as language-specific home pages, such as en.wikipedia.org and
          de.wikipedia.org.
